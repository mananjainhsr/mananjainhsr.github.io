Hi, my name is Korukonda Viswaraj, I was born in Rajahmundry: a picturesque city on the banks of River Godavari situated in Andhra Pradesh and I grew up in Chennai, the healthcare capital of India also called the Detroit of Asia. I am currently studying at the <b>Indian Institute of Management, Rohtak </b> pursuing the 5-year Integrated Programme in Management. I completed my whole schooling in a single school named <b> Bharathi Vidyalaya Senior Secondary School </b> where I was elected as the School Pupil Leader and helped me  skills such as leadership, management and also learning about responsibilities fullfiling duties as a leader. I wished to be an entrpreneur since childhood and that inspired me to take up this course of business administration that helped me strengthen my leadership and management skills. </p>

I am presently the co-cordinator of Vedin, the academic club at the institute. It was an added advantage that I had already the experience of high student positions at school which enabled to me handle crisis situations with relative ease. As academics highly interest me, I am always fascinated by the world of finance and the money theories. The complex web of money being theorized is a piece of art and it has to be savoured. I also love the Indian mythology and the underlying thinking fascinates me and motivates me to be a scientific, rational thinker. The society with half knowledge do not recognise or acknowledge the foundations of such ideologies and I wish to change that. </p>

</div>

<p>Being inquisitve is in my blood and I believe I have a lot of curiousity by nature and it helped me develop such hobbies where i keep discovering new things from time to time. 
</p>
<br>
Some of my hobbies are: 
<dl>
<dt><strong>Sports</strong></dt>
<dd>Since my early age, I was thrilled by the sporting world and I actively follow Cricket, Tennis, Football, F1, Badminton and the Olympics. I also play Cricket, Tennis, Football and Badminton during leisure time</dd>
<dt><strong>Quzzing</strong></dt>
<dd>Quzzing provides an oppurtunity to learn new things daily and also helps to puzzle my brain to think out of the box. I have also been to the regional finals of TATA Crucible which was streamed on YouTube also.</dd>
<dt><strong>Coding</strong></dt>
<dd>Coding helps me to break complex problems into smaller simpler problems and solve them with much ease, the same principle applied to life also makes life much merrier. During my school days, I developed a Stock Market Trading system using Java and MySQL.</dd>
<dt><strong>Music</strong></dt>
<dd>I love to listen to music during any part of the day and in whatever mood I am. Music helps me to rejuvenate myself after a stressful day</dd>
