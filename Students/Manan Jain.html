My Name is Manan Jain , I am currently a final year student at <b><i>Indian Institute of Management Rohtak </i></b> pursuing my Bachelor’s degree majoring in Business Administration, from which I will be graduating in June 2022. I was born and brought up in Hisar which is a small town situated in Haryana state of India, majorly known for its steel industry and agriculture universities. I completed my schooling from <b><i>OP Jindal Modern School Hisar</i></b> and received a perfect 10 CGPA in 10th Standard.  I have a deep interest in Finance; hence I am also preparing for CFA Level 1, which I would be attempting in February 2022.

<p align = "justify">
  While pursuing my Bachelors, I have learned about corporates and understood how businesses works, out of the various aspects and dimensions of businesses that I have learned, Finance was something towards which I felt attracted hence I am planning to build my career in the Finance Industry. In the Summers of 2020, I worked as a Marketing & Research Intern at the Indian Government’s Start-up Support Incubation Centre, where I primarily worked with the Marketing Team. I worked on developing the Influencer Marketing strategy, which required me to interact with people from different domains, this helped me develop my interpersonal skills and, at the same time, learn about various industries in which these people were involved. 
<p align="justify">
  Currently, I am also undergoing research on <b><i>Nudge Marketing Theory</i></b> to understand consumer psychology, I believe the organisational goal of any business regardless of the nature of business it is involved in Sales, hence exploring this aspect will give me better understanding of businesses in general.</p>

</div>

<p>Being inquisitve is in my blood and I believe I have a lot of curiousity by nature and it helped me develop such hobbies where i keep discovering new things from time to time. 
</p>
<br>
Some of my hobbies are: 
<dl>
<dt><strong>Sports</strong></dt>
<dd>Since my early age, I was thrilled by the sporting world and I actively follow Cricket, Tennis, Football, F1, Badminton and the Olympics. I also play Cricket, Tennis, Football and Badminton during leisure time</dd>
<dt><strong>Quzzing</strong></dt>
<dd>Quzzing provides an oppurtunity to learn new things daily and also helps to puzzle my brain to think out of the box. I have also been to the regional finals of TATA Crucible which was streamed on YouTube also.</dd>
<dt><strong>Coding</strong></dt>
<dd>Coding helps me to break complex problems into smaller simpler problems and solve them with much ease, the same principle applied to life also makes life much merrier. During my school days, I developed a Stock Market Trading system using Java and MySQL.</dd>
<dt><strong>Music</strong></dt>
<dd>I love to listen to music during any part of the day and in whatever mood I am. Music helps me to rejuvenate myself after a stressful day</dd>
