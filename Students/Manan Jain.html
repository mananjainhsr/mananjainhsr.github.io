My Name is Manan Jain , I am currently a final year student at <b><i>Indian Institute of Management Rohtak </i></b> pursuing my Bachelor’s degree majoring in Business Administration, from which I will be graduating in June 2022. I was born and brought up in Hisar which is a small town situated in Haryana state of India, majorly known for its steel industry and agriculture universities. I completed my schooling from <b><i>OP Jindal Modern School Hisar</i></b> and received a perfect 10 CGPA in 10th Standard.  I have a deep interest in Finance; hence I am also preparing for CFA Level 1, which I would be attempting in February 2022.

  While pursuing my Bachelors, I have learned about corporates and understood how businesses works, out of the various aspects and dimensions of businesses that I have learned, Finance was something towards which I felt attracted hence I am planning to build my career in the Finance Industry. In the Summers of 2020, I worked as a Marketing & Research Intern at the Indian Government’s Start-up Support Incubation Centre, where I primarily worked with the Marketing Team. I worked on developing the Influencer Marketing strategy, which required me to interact with people from different domains, this helped me develop my interpersonal skills and, at the same time, learn about various industries in which these people were involved. 
<p align="justify">
  Currently, I am also undergoing research on <b><i>Nudge Marketing Theory</i></b> to understand consumer psychology, I believe the organisational goal of any business regardless of the nature of business it is involved in Sales, hence exploring this aspect will give me better understanding of businesses in general.</p>

<p> I beleive its education is not just aboout academic part but about the overall holistic development of a person, All these years I have tried keeping a balance among the two and on the way have developed certain hobbies and interests. They help me keeping myself equipped as well as act as a stress coping mechanism </p>

<i>Some of my hobbies are: </i>

<dt><strong>Writing</strong></dt>
<dd>This hobby is something which I have discovered recently.  Whenever I found myself free I love to write about various topics including but not restricted to finance , startups etc. I believe in sharing ideas hence most of the stuff that I write I publish them on <a href=https://www.quora.com/profile/Manan-Jain-341 target="_blank">Quora</a></dd>
